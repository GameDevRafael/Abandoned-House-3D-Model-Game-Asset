# Game Asset: Abandoned Wooden House 3D Model

## Overview

This project showcases a game-ready 3D model of an **abandoned wooden house**, designed **100% by me** and textured entirely in Blender and exported to Unity. The model represents a rustic, weathered house with realistic features such as broken windows, wooden planks obstructing access, a rusted gutter, a small porch and garage doors. Fully optimized for game engines, it's ideal for horror, survival or post-apocalyptic environments.

## Key Technical Achievements

- Developed a detailed 3D house model with 10,547 vertices, balancing performance and detail.
- Applied advanced Blender techniques, including:
    - Procedural and manual modeling
    - Complex modifiers (Displacement, Boolean, Array)
- Optimized topology for game engine performance
- Successfully integrated the asset into Unity, with PBR textures and normal maps intact.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- 3D Modeling and Texturing
- PBR Workflow Implementation
- Game Asset Optimization
- Blender-to-Unity Workflow

## Project Highlights

- Realistic Modeling: Broken windows, wood planks obstructing points of access, disfigured wooden walls/floor, garage doors and a small and simple porch.
- Textures: Imported high-quality PBR materials (wood, metal, roofing) from Poly Haven.
- Game Engine Compatibility: Fully exported to Unity in FBX format, preserving all details and textures.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained experience with handling complex modifiers (Boolean, Displacement, Array) to achieve realistic effects.
- Addressed technical challenges such as removing non-manifold geometries and maintaning a clean mesh (only tris and quads).

## Use Case

This asset is designed for game developers needing realistic, abandoned structures for their environments. Ideal for genres such as survival, horror or exploration games.

## Future Work

- Add animations (e.g., swaying wooden planks, creaking doors).
- Create additional assets to complement the house in a cohesive environment.
